How to work with me
Last update: November 24, 2023

This is a document outlining my guiding principles and preferences for collaboration. It serves as a basis for effective communication and workflow.

**Adaptability:** I'm flexible, so let's figure out our best workflow together.

**Living Document:** This document is dynamic. I'll update it regularly and welcome your feedback.

### I like to...

1. **Question Things:** Feel free to question and provide documentation or presentations for context.

2. **Work Asynchronously:** Prefer asynchronous work over unnecessary meetings. 

3. **Learn Everything:** I want to understand systems comprehensively.

4. **Be Professionally Casual:** Inject humor into our interactions.

5. **Think in Dots:** Visualize and connect concepts simplistically.

6. **Be Aligned and Clarified:** Ensure everyone involved knows what, why, and how we're proceeding.

### I expect you to...

1. **Prove Me Wrong:** Challenge my ideas constructively.

2. **Respect Promises:** Be punctual and keep commitments for trust and credibility.

3. **Overcommunicate:** Transparency is crucial; share relevant information.

4. **Be Proactive:** Engage in discussions actively; propose alternatives.

### How I use my time

I manage my time wisely, responding to emails at night. Let's establish dedicated working hours for synchronous communication or meetings.
